# Typemart

## About

Typemart is an online shop that processes customer orders and prints a receipt with the order and shipping details. This is a mini project that puts into practice TypeScript fundamentals - annotating types and fixing type errors - to ensure a simple purchase flow that is type-safe.

## Features

- Uses the array find() method to search for the customer's chosen item by iterating through the array of products and returning the matching product details.
- The purchase flow checks if the item is on 'pre-order' and notifies the customer if so.
- The program checks if the item qualifies for free shipping.
- Checks the amount of tax to be paid based on the shipping address.
- Type annotated variables to ensure type safety.
- Calculates the order total and prints a receipt with the product name, shipping address, and breakdown of the total.

## Technologies used
